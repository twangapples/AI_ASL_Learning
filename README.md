# AI_ASL_Learning
Deep learning model for recognizing American Sign Language gestures using a CNN.

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures from 28×28 grayscale images. The model was trained in Google Colab using TensorFlow/Keras, saved as a .keras file, and integrated into a local Python environment for real-time predictions and image visualization.
